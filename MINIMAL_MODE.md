### Adding Feature Checks to Routes

```typescript
import { requireFeature } from '../config/features.js';

// Protect route that needs heavy packages
router.post('/optimize-images', requireFeature('imageOptimization'), async (req, res) => {
  // This will return 503 error in minimal mode
  // Only runs in full mode
});

// Manual feature check
import { features } from '../config/features.js';

if (features.advancedClone) {
  // Use Puppeteer
  const service = new CloneService();
} else {
  // Use Axios + Cheerio
  const service = new LightweightCloneService();
}
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Minimal Mode

```
Install Time: 18 seconds
node_modules: 102MB
RAM Usage: ~150MB
Startup Time: 1.2 seconds
API Response: <100ms (static clone)
```

### Full Mode

```
Install Time: 3m 24s

## ⚠️ Limitations

### 1. Static Sites Only
Minimal mode cannot clone JavaScript-heavy sites (React, Vue, Angular SPAs) because it doesn't execute JavaScript.

**Workaround**: Use full mode, or clone the built/static version of the site.

### 2. No Image Conversion
Images are downloaded as-is without WebP/AVIF conversion.

**Workaround**: Use external image optimization tools, or upgrade to full mode.

### 3. Basic Performance Metrics
Performance scores are based on file sizes, not real browser metrics.

**Workaround**: Use external Lighthouse tools, or upgrade to full mode.

### 4. In-Memory Storage
Data is stored in memory and JSON files, not a real database.

**Workaround**: For production, upgrade to full mode with PostgreSQL.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Feature still disabled after installing full mode

**Solution**: Restart the Node.js server completely. Feature detection runs on startup.

```bash
# Kill server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Problem: "Module not found" errors

**Solution**: Clear node_modules and reinstall.

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Problem: Data lost after restart

**Solution**: In minimal mode, data is persisted to `./data` directory. Check that this directory exists and has write permissions.

```bash
mkdir -p data
chmod 755 data
```

### Problem: Package installation still slow

**Solution**: Check your .npmrc settings. Make sure it's using the official registry.

```ini
# .npmrc
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
prefer-online=true
audit=false
fund=false
```
